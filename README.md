**Titanic Data Cleaning Project**
📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning the Titanic dataset, a classic beginner-friendly dataset widely used in data science. The goal is to prepare the raw data for analysis and modeling by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data, and improving data quality.

**📊 Dataset Description**

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including details like:

PassengerId – Unique ID for each passenger

Survived – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass – Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Name, Sex, Age – Personal details

SibSp, Parch – Family relationships aboard

Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked – Travel details

**🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps**

In this project, the following cleaning operations were performed:

Handling Missing Values

Filled missing Age values with the mean.

Filled missing Embarked values with the most frequent value (mode).

Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive null values.

Removing Duplicates

Checked and removed any duplicate records.

Data Standardization

Standardized text in the Sex column (e.g., "male" → "Male").

Converted Survived and Pclass columns to categorical types.

Renaming Columns

Renamed SibSp to Siblings_Spouses and Parch to Parents_Children for better clarity.

Saving Cleaned Data

Exported the final cleaned dataset as cleaned_titanic.csv.
